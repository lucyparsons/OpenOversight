            This project is a response to the lack of transparency and justice in policing. The public should have the right to know which officers are patrolling their neighborhoods and watching their communities. When officers abuse their positions of power, they should be able to be easily identified and held accountable.

            It is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was first implemented in Chicago in October 2016.
            OpenOversight launched in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area in fall 2017 and in New York City in 2018. A
            Baltimore instance was launched in 2019 at <a href="https://bpdwatch.com">BPDWatch.com</a>.

            OpenOversight is released as free and open source software so others can launch similar law enforcement accountability
            projects in their own cities. The software is available for download and collaborative development on

        <h2>Press Release</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched
          OpenOversight, an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify
          police officers, including for the purpose of complaints. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a
          database
          of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number
          of
          the offending officer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whom they
          have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the
          OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures
          of officers in uniform to assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by police," says
          Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead developer on the OpenOversight project. "Police are almost
          never held accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct complaint, the burden is on the
          public to provide as much detailed data about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower citizens with
          tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them accountable."

          Less than 2% of the 28,567 complaints filed against the Chicago
          police department from March 2011 to September 2015 resulted in discipline. Most officers who do face
          discipline
          are suspended for a week or less.
