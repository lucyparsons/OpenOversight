<h1>About OpenOversight</h1>
<p>OpenOversight is a <a href="https://lucyparsonslabs.com">Lucy Parsons Labs</a> project to improve police accountability using public and crowdsourced data. We maintain databases of police officers in several cities, providing digital galleries that make identifying police officers easier for the public, including for the purpose of complaints.</p>
<p><a href="/find" class="btn btn-info" id="try-it">Try it</a></p>

<p>This project is a direct response to the failure of leaders in local governments to implement systems that effectively and safely allow the public to identify and report problem police officers. It is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was first implemented in Chicago in October 2016. In fall 2017, OpenOversight launched in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>OpenOversight is released as free and open source software so others can launch similar police accountability projects in their own cities. The software is available for download and collaborative development on <a href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/OpenOversight">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Press Release</h2>

<p>In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched OpenOversight, an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify police officers, including for the purpose of complains.  We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number of the offending officer.</p>

<p>Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whome they have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures of officers in uniform to assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by Chicago police," says Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead developer on the OpenOversight project. "Despite a long history of proven abuses, including torture, Chicago police are almost never held accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct complaint, the burden is on the public to provide as much detailed data about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower Chicagoans with tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them accountable."

<h4>Facts and Figures about Chicago Police Department:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To file a police complaint in Chicago, a member of the public needs to know as much <a href="http://ipraportal.iprachicago.org/pls/htmldb/f?p=1503:12:5406784243929236">detailed data</a> about the officer as possible. Based on complaints data from the <a href="http://invisible.institute/">Invisible Institute</a>, from March 2011 - March 2015, 28% of complaints (4,000 total complaints) were immediately dropped due to no officer identification.  <a href="http://cpdp.co/data/D8or5A/only-20525-28595-have-id-for-the-accused-officer">Source: Citizen Police Data Project</a></li>

Most officers who do face discipline are suspended for a week or less.  <a href="http://cpdb.co/data/D1zdwL/citizens-police-data-project">Source: Citizens Police Data Project</a></li>
  <li>Chicago spent over $500 million from 2004 to 2014 on settlements, legal fees and other costs related to complaints against police officers.  <a href="http://www.bettergov.org/news/beyond-burge">Source: Better Government Association</a></li>
