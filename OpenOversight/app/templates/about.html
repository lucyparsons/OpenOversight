    OpenOversight is a <a href="https://lucyparsonslabs.com">Lucy Parsons Labs</a> project to improve police
    accountability using public and crowdsourced data. We maintain databases of police officers in several cities,
    providing digital galleries that make identifying police officers easier for the public, including for the purpose
    of complaints.

      <p>This project is a direct response to the failure of leaders in local governments to implement systems that
        effectively and safely allow the public to identify and report problematic police officers.

        It is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was first implemented in Chicago in October 2016.

      OpenOversight is released as free and open source software so others can launch similar police accountability

    <h2>Press Release</h2>
    <p>In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched
      OpenOversight, an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify
      police officers, including for the purpose of complains. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a
      database
      of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number
      of
      the offending officer.</p>

    <p>Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whom they
      have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the
      OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures
      of officers in uniform to assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by police," says
      Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead developer on the OpenOversight project. "Police are almost
      never held accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct complaint, the burden is on the
      public to provide as much detailed data about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower citizens with
      tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them accountable."

        To file a police complaint in Chicago, a member of the public needs
        to know as much
        <a href="http://ipraportal.iprachicago.org/pls/htmldb/f?p=1503:12:5406784243929236">detailed data</a>
        about the officer as possible. Based on complaints data from the <a href="http://invisible.institute/">Invisible
        Institute</a>, from March 2011 - March 2015, 28% of complaints (4,000 total complaints) were immediately
        dropped due to no officer identification.

        Less than 2% of the 28,567 complaints filed against the Chicago
        police department from March 2011 to September 2015 resulted in discipline. Most officers who do face
        discipline
        are suspended for a week or less.
