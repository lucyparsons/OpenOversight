    OpenOversight is a <a href="https://lucyparsonslabs.com">Lucy Parsons Labs</a> project that aims to improve law enforcement
    visibility and transparency using public and crowdsourced data. We maintain databases, digital galleries, and profiles of individual law enforcement officers from departments
    across the United States that consolidate information including names, birthdates, mentions in news articles, salaries, and photographs.

      <p>This project is a response to the lack of transparency and justice in policing. The public should have the right to know which officers are patrolling their neighborhoods and watching their communities. When officers abuse their positions of power, they should be able to be easily identified and held accountable.

        It is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was first implemented in Chicago in October 2016.
      In fall 2017, OpenOversight launched in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area.
      Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were added to OpenOversight in June 2018.
      OpenOversight will launch in New York City in fall 2018.

      OpenOversight is released as free and open source software so others can launch similar law enforcement accountability
        projects in their own cities. The software is available for download and collaborative development on
      <a href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/OpenOversight">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>Press Release</h2>
    <p class="text-left">In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched
      OpenOversight, an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify
      police officers, including for the purpose of complains. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a
      database
      of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number
      of
      the offending officer.</p>

    <p class="text-left">Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whom they
      have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the
      OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures
      of officers in uniform to assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by police," says
      Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead developer on the OpenOversight project. "Police are almost
      never held accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct complaint, the burden is on the
      public to provide as much detailed data about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower citizens with
      tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them accountable."

        To file a police complaint in Chicago, a member of the public needs
        to know as much
        <a href="http://ipraportal.iprachicago.org/pls/htmldb/f?p=1503:12:5406784243929236">detailed data</a>
        about the officer as possible. Based on complaints data from the <a href="http://invisible.institute/">Invisible
        Institute</a>, from March 2011 - March 2015, 28% of complaints (4,000 total complaints) were immediately
        dropped due to no officer identification.

        Less than 2% of the 28,567 complaints filed against the Chicago
        police department from March 2011 to September 2015 resulted in discipline. Most officers who do face
        discipline
        are suspended for a week or less.
