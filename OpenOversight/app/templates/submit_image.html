   <h3>High Security Submissions</h3>
   <p class="small">We do not log unique identifying information of visitors to our website, but if you have privacy concerns in submitting photographs, we recommend using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser.</a> For very high security submissions of photos or videos, you can use an anonymous dropbox called SecureDrop (launch instructions below). All files that we receive through SecureDrop are <a href="https://mat.boum.org/">scrubbed of metadata.</a></p>
