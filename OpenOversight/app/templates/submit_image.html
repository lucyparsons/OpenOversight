      <h3>What happens when I submit a photograph?</h3>
      <p>The next step after a photograph of an officer has been submitted is to match it to the correct badge number, name, and OpenOversight ID (a unique identifier in our system). Volunteers <a href="https://openoversight.com/label">sort through submitted images</a> by first confirming that officers are present in each photograph, and then by matching each photograph to the officer it depicts.</p>
