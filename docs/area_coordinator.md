Area Coordinator
================

An area coordinator is a person with an account on
OpenOversight that is charged with curating the collection for a particular
department. There can be several area coordinators for a given department.
The tasks they perform include:

* Add new officers
* Update officer information, such as new assignments or promotions
* Add private notes to particular officer profiles (visible to other area
  coordinators or administrators)
* Add a brief description to an officer's profile
* Add links and videos to officer's profiles
* Add incidents linked to one or more officers
