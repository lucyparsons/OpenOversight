OpenOversight is a Lucy Parsons Labs project to improve law enforcement
accountability through public and crowdsourced data. We maintain a database
of officer demographic information and provide digital galleries of photographs.
This is done to help people identify law enforcement officers for filing
complaints and in order for the public to see work-related information about
law enforcement officers that interact with the public.
