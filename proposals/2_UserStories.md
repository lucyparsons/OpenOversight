# OpenOversight User Stories

## Complainant

A complainant should be able to go to our website, look up where, when, and any detail about the officer. They should be served with a Digital Gallery. If they have a picture, they should upload it and get a Digital Gallery with the highest probability matches based on facial recognition included.

## Complaint Platform

We should integrate this service into a platform such as Open Police Complaints to get additional users as well as provide the identities of officers for the platform's complainants.

## OpenOversight contributor: Images

A contributor should be able to submit images through the web application. Users should first sign in and their account will be credited with the find. They can see how they compare to others through the data collection Leaderboard.

## OpenOversight contributor: Human labelling

We will need humans initially to manually tag images to attach them to given officers. This can be done by viewing their badge number. Users should first sign in and their account will be credited with the work. Multiple users should verify each image for data quality purposes.
